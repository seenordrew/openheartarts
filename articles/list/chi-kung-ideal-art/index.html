      <p>Living in the Information Age where a person can learn about any subject they desire with a simple internet search means they can be highly informed before choosing a meditative practice, but it also means there are thousands of arts to choose from.  Picking just one to dedicate your time to can seem confusing, so this article will cover why Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung is a particularly excellent art for personal development in modern times.</p>

      <p>Please note that one article cannot cover every single reason why Cosmos Chi Kung is an excellent practice, but the most predominant reasons are covered here.</p>

      <h3>Practice Sessions are Short</h3>

      <p>One of the main obstacles that people talk about in terms of maintaining a consistent, daily practice of a meditative art is their lack of time.  Taking one to two hours out of their busy schedule to dedicate to an art like chi kung, yoga, tai chi, meditation, etc. seems unrealistic to many people, and perhaps it is.  The beauty of Cosmos Chi Kung is that, compared to many other arts, it requires very little time to complete one full practice session.  In general, the recommended time for one session of Cosmos Chi Kung is 10-20 minutes.  This might seem too short to a lot of people, but the truth is that, because this style of chi kung is so efficient and effective, 10-20 minutes is plenty.</p>

      <h3>Cosmos Chi Kung is Highly Efficient</h3>

      <p>This is an art that has been passed down and fine-tuned by masters for centuries, so what we are practicing today is a very refined, effective and efficient art.  Anything unnecessary has been filtered out, leaving only the most important aspects of the art in place.  So, we can now practice a style of chi kung that meets our needs quickly.  How quickly?  10-20 minutes a day.  To be fair, the ideal amount of Cosmos Chi Kung is to practice once in the morning and once in the evening, each session lasting 10-20 minutes, but practicing just once a day will still bring great benefits.</p>

      <h3>Every Session of Chi Kung is “Triple Cultivation”</h3>

      <p>Part of what makes Cosmos Chi Kung so effective is that the practice is not divided up into different practices, with one practice focusing on the physical body, another focusing on energy, and another focusing on developing the mind.  We develop every level in each session of chi kung.  Not every practice session will work on each level equally, but each level will be developed.</p>

      <h3>Cosmos Chi Kung is Available to Everyone</h3>

      <p>Cosmos Chi Kung is not restricted to people of a certain class, country or religion.  It is able to be practiced by people of any religion, ethnicity, gender or any other other label.  There are no dietary restrictions, no special clothes are needed and you need not seek out a special temple for your practice.  The main requirement is a willingness to practice once a day, following the instructions of your teacher.</p>

      <h3>Once You Learn It, You Can Practice For Life</h3>

      <p>To competently learn a genuine internal art, such as Cosmos Chi Kung, it's necessary to learn it directly from a qualified teacher.  But, once you have adequately learned how to practice chi kung, you can continue your independent practice every day for the rest of your life.  It's highly recommended to maintain contact with your teacher for guidance as necessary, but it's not required to continue attending courses.  So, if you attend an intensive course where you learn Cosmos Chi Kung over two days, you're set!  In those two days you receive the essence of a practice that will continue to blossom as you carry on your personal practice.</p>

      <h3>Cosmos Chi Kung is Highly Enjoyable</h3>

      <p>And, finally, perhaps the most important point: it is a great joy to practice Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung!  Not only is the actual practice very enjoyable, but practitioners commonly report that their overall quality of life improves after starting their practice.  This makes complete sense, as Cosmos Chi Kung flushes away physical and emotional pains, improves your outlook on life, enhances your energy levels, opens your heart to enjoy life and frees your spirit.  It didn’t take long for chi kung to become an indispensable part of my life, and I sincerely hope you will take the time to enjoy this precious art as well.</p>
