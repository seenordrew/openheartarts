			<p>Yes, it is certainly possible to enjoy true inner peace.</p>  

			<p>Inner peace here is defined as a state in which a person does not feel overwhelmed by emotions, thoughts, stress or anxiety and feels a continuous sense of well-being, balance and joy.  Such a state might seem like a fairy tale or unattainable fantasy to many people given how most people feel on a daily basis, but it really is an experience available to all.</p>  

			<p class="quote-large">Inner peace is not something to be attained, achieved or discovered; it’s within all of us.</p>

			<p>What’s missing for most people is simply putting the time and attention necessary on their inner state to return to this state of peace.  I phrase this as “return to” because feeling peace and joy is actually each person’s natural state that humans have collectively strayed from.  Inner peace is not something to be attained, achieved or discovered; it’s within all of us.  Rather than being like inventing the light bulb, it’s like a bright light bulb that already exists but is covered in so much dust and dirt than the light is not visible.  All that’s necessary is to wipe away the dust and dirt and the light will shine again.</p>

			<h3>How Does One Return to Peace?</h3>

			<p>So much of returning to peace is simply letting go of that which prevents it: old grudges, insecurities, stagnant emotions, stress, negative thinking.  People are often so caught up in all this noise that it’s considered normal to live in that state, but it doesn’t have to be that way.</p>

			<p>Just as there are many paths of spiritual cultivation, there are many paths for this return to peace.  While they may look different externally, at their essence all the paths will address the same fundamental components.  To enjoy inner peace, a person must balance their emotions, vital energies and mental energies.</p>  

			<p>Balancing one’s emotions doesn’t mean a total annihilation of emotions.  It means that a person feels inner peace and isn’t overrun with anger, sadness, guilt, resentment, happiness, jealousy, excitement, etc.  Even positive emotions need to be balanced.  For example, if a person attempts to maintain a high level of excitement all the time, it puts a strain on their inner state and it won’t allow for balance.  When a person’s emotions are balanced, even if an emotion such as anger arises, the person is aware of it and can manage it appropriately.  The emotion also won’t stay for very long because the person can easily let it go.  This is connected to the concept of “emotional intelligence.”</p>

			<p>“Vital energies” refers to what other languages call “chi”, “ki” or “prana”.  Energy arts like chi kung focus on cleansing, building and nourishing a person’s vital energy system as a means of attaining good health, vitality and longevity.  A person whose vital energy is balanced will have good health, vitality, plenty of energy for work and play and feel zestful.</p>

			<p>“Mental energies” refers to thought patterns about oneself, about others, perspectives, perceptions, habits, and largely dictates our experience of the world.  A person whose mental energies are imbalanced might be depressed, might always perceive themself as a victim, might have chronic negative thinking, might have unresolved past trauma, etc.  These are still forms of energy and can be balanced through practices like therapy, counseling, mindfulness, chi kung and meditation.  A person whose mental energies are balanced will naturally be optimistic, their thinking will be clear, practices like meditation will feel much easier and their inner peace will be much deeper.</p>

			<h3>How Can I Make the Return?</h3>

			<p>The process of returning to peace is quite simple, though in practice it might not be easy.  Fortuntely, at this point in time we have the benefit of being able to practice internal arts that have been developed and passed down over thousands of years, resulting in complete systems that guide the path of returning to peace.  The arts that I have practiced since 2005 and, in my experience have been very effective in aiding the return to peace, have been Shaolin Cosmos Chi Kung, mindfulness, mantras and Zen meditation.</p>  

			<p class="quote-large">There is no better investment than in your own inner cultivation for the benefit of yourself and those around you.</p>

			<p>It’s worth pointing out that starting the practice of each in the order listed is ideal, as it allows for a relative progression from cleansing out “lower level” rubbish like emotions and anxiety to “higher level” rubbish like deeply engrained mental patterns.  These individual practices are explored more in-depth in other articles on this website.</p>

			<h3>Make It Happen</h3>

			<p>If you’re at a point where you are ready to give up living in a state of suffering and want to return to peace, learning these practices from a competent teacher and practicing daily is an excellent path forward.  Making the decision to make a change and getting started is always the most difficult step but once you experience just a glimpse of true inner peace your life witll change forever.</p>  

			<p>As with anything, some effort is necessary to attain the desired results, but there is no better investment than in your own inner cultivation for the benefit of yourself and those around you.</p>
