      <p>While Zen has become quite popular in the West, the tradition of Advaita Vedanta is generally not very well-known.  Because the two traditions of spiritual cultivation are so similar I thought I'd compare and contrast them here, just for fun.</p>

<p>I won’t be detailing historical facts.  This will primarily look at aspects of the actual practices themselves, with some minor background information for context.</p>

<h3>What is Advaita Vedanta?</h3>

<p>Advaita (non-dual) Vedanta (what comes at the end of the Vedas), often referred to just as  Vedanta, is a branch of Hinduism that focuses on non-dualism.  Per Vedanta philosophy, the physical world (maya) is an illusion created by the mind and is a result of considering oneself to be separate from the Divine.  Once the mind is transcended and the true self is realized (or remembered), an individual returns to Sat-Chit-Ananda (Being-Consciousness-Bliss).  When that happens, duality ceases, thus the focus on attaining non-duality.</p>

<h3>Mind-Only Approach</h3>

<p>The most important aspect of each tradition is the application of the "Mind-Only" approach.  Both traditions get straight to the crux of all spiritual endeavor and don’t put much focus on outer rituals or activities.  The gist of both practices is, “Investigate the mind and it will disappear.”  Since the entire physical universe is a creation of the mind, and the limited mind is what continues our ignorance that keeps us from knowing our true Self (God/Buddha Nature), one should go straight to transcending the mind.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>Just as the spider emits the thread (of the web) out of itself and again withdraws it into itself, likewise the mind projects the world out of itself and again resolves it into itself. When the mind comes out of the Self, the world appears. Therefore, when the world appears (to be real), the Self does not appear; and when the Self appears (shines) the world does not appear. When one persistently inquires into the nature of the mind, the mind will end leaving the Self (as the residue). What is referred to as the Self is the Atman. The mind always exists only in dependence on something gross; it cannot stay alone. It is the mind that is called the subtle body or the soul (jiva).</i><br><br>
<u>Who Am I?</u> - Ramana Maharshi</p>

<p>Bodhidharma also expounded the Mind-Only approach.  Legend says that when Bodhidharma named Huike as his successor, he gave him his copy of the Lankāvatāra Sutra and told him that everything he needed to know was in the text.  The Lankāvatāra Sutra focuses heavily on the Mind-Only teaching.</p>

<p>I wrote a little bit about the similarity in language of Vedanta texts and the Lankāvatāra Sutra 
<a href="https://www.wongkiewkit.com/forum/forum/buddhism-and-other-spiritual-systems/buddhism/13114-" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h3>How to Investigate the Mind</h3>

<p>What initially drew my attention to the similarity between Zen and Vedanta is the importance placed on Self-Inquiry.  In Vedanta, ātma-vichār is the practice of investigating the mind.  This is most commonly done through the question “Who am I?”  It’s not a mantra or something to be repeated mechanically, but forms the basis for the actual investigative practice.</p>  

<p class="quote"><i>The thought ‘who am I?’ will destroy all other thoughts, and like the stick used for stirring the burning pyre, it will itself in the end get destroyed. Then, there will arise Self-realization.</i><br><br>

<u>Who Am I?</u> - Ramana Maharshi</p>

<p>In Zen, there is a practice called “Hua Tou”, which focuses on employing questioning like “Who am I?”, “Who is repeating the Buddha’s name?” and “What was my Original Face before my father and mother were born?”  The late Master Hsuan Hua refers to the practice of investigating the mind as “Investigating Chan”.</p>

<p class="quote"><i>The goal of investigating Chan is to understand the mind and see the true nature. That is, to remove all the defilements in our minds and to actually see the image of our self-nature. Defilements refer to false thoughts and attachments, while the self-nature refers to our inherent wisdom and virtue, which is identical to that of all Buddhas. The Thus Come Ones’ wisdom and virtue is embodied within all Buddhas and sentient beings and is not dual or different.</i><br><br>

<p>The point is the same: when you turn the mind in on itself, it disappears and your True Nature shines.  It should be noted that the questioning eventually falls away and only silence remains.  At the highest level, the questioning isn’t needed anymore since the illusion of the mind is gone.</p>


<h3>Jñāna Yoga, Bhakti Yoga, Karma Yoga</h3>

<p>Hinduism has three overall paths for attaining Self-realization: "Jñāna Yoga" (Path of Knowledge), "Bhakti Yoga" (Path of Devotion) and "Karma Yoga" (Path of Action).</p>

<p><b>Jñāna Yoga</b> is done primarily through the practice of self-inquiry.</p>

<p><b>Bhakti Yoga</b> focuses on devotional practices with the aim of one’s devotion becoming so deep that the subject forgets any separation between themself and the object - the Divine.  The focus of the devotion is on whatever form most appeals to the individual, such as Krishna, Shiva or Kāli Mā.  In Buddhism, the devotion is usually towards a Buddha or Bodhisattva, such as Śakyamuni Buddha, Amitābha Buddha or Avalokiteśvāra Bodhisattva.  Bhakti Yoga is generally the focus of most religions.</p>

<p><b>Karma Yoga</b> focuses on serving the Divine through actions that serve humanity, since serving humanity is serving God.  The focus is to give up all thought that one is the “doer” of the actions and see oneself as a vehicle of service for the will of the Divine.  Performing actions this way is a means of purifying oneself and gradually eliminating the egoic self.  This can be compared to the ideal of the Bodhisattva - one who sacrifices themself to serve others.  A Bodhisattva is often seen is a highly advanced spiritual being that puts off final enlightenment in order to aid sentient beings, but a Bodhisattva can also be any being who gives themself up to the service others.</p>
