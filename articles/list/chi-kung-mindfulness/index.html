      <p>While the practice of mindfulness has gained popularity in recent years, it is by no means something new.  The practice of being mindful of one’s thoughts is at the very core of spiritual traditions dating back thousands of years.  Mindfulness is in itself a fantastic practice, which I highly recommend, but this article will focus on how mindfulness is ingrained in Cosmos Chi Kung.</p>

    <p>Every session of Cosmos Chi Kung follows the same basic structure:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>Enter Zen/“chi kung state of mind”</li>
      <li>Perform a chi kung technique to generate a flow of energy</li>
      <li>Allow the chi to flow freely</li>
      <li>Center the energy at the "dan tian", enter standing meditation</li>
    </ol>

    <p>As you can see, the very first stage of a session of chi kung is entering Zen, or as we more commonly call it in Shaolin Wahnam, “entering a chi kung state of mind.”  At this stage we enter silence and cease to think.  It’s common for beginners in their first few sessions to be a bit surprised by this, and perhaps have thoughts of, “Am I not thinking?  Should I be thinking of something?  Hey look I’m not thinking!”  To this, the advice is, “Simply let go of your thoughts.”  With practice, these thoughts cease and the practitioner simply enjoys the mental stillness.  That is the Zen approach to mindfulness.  You don’t philosophize about how to let your thoughts go, or if some thoughts are better than others or if you’re doing it correctly.  You just let them go.  Enjoying a state totally free of thoughts generally takes quite some time to reach, but with Cosmos Chi Kung it can be reached relatively quickly.</p>

    <p>At stage two, a practitioner enjoys being mindful of their movements and their breathing while they feel their energy flow increasing.  This is highly effective for improving mindfulness since it combines the physical body, breathing, energy and the mind.  Rather than aiming straight away at total mindfulness using only the mind, combining these four components makes it easier for a beginner to keep the mind focused.</p>

    <p>At stage three a practitioner lets go and allows the chi flow they’ve generated to cleanse their system.  If a person has a physical ailment, such as heavy pain, the constant pain could distract their mind.  By flushing out the physical blockage, the pain will go away and their mental focus will improve.  If a person has emotional blockages, the strain of emotional imbalance will prevent mental clarity and peace.  By clearing away those emotions, again the peace and clarity of the mind will improve.  This same basic process holds true for energetic and mental imbalances.</p>

    <p>Completing the session at stage four, the practitioner brings the chi flow to a graceful stop and returns to Zen, which we call “standing meditation.”  Once again this is a time of no-thought in which the person simply enjoys their breathing while feeling stillness and freshness.  At this stage, a person might not “practice mindfulness” as it is generally understood; rather, they will enjoy the result of the practice - mental quietude.  They might find it to be a state beyond words; a state beyond differentiation, beyond “yin and yang.”  Of course, this must be experienced to be truly appreciated.</p>
